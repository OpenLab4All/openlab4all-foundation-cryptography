# OpenLab4All.Foundation.Cryptography

**OpenLab4All.Foundation.Cryptography** is part of the `OpenLab4All.Foundation` libraries.  
It delivers a set of secure and consistent cryptographic helpers for .NET applications, covering symmetric encryption, hashing, key derivation, and data encoding.

## Features
- **CryptoBox** - high-level API for authenticated symmetric encryption (AES-CBC + HMAC-SHA256).
- **AesCbc** - low-level AES-CBC encryption/decryption helper.
- **Hash / Hmac** - SHA-256, SHA-512, and keyed HMAC operations.
- **Kdf** - PBKDF2 key derivation for password-based secrets.
- **CryptoRandom** - secure random number generation.
- **Base64Url / Bytes** - conversion utilities for Base64Url, hex, and UTF-8.
- **ConstantTime** - fixed-time equality check.
